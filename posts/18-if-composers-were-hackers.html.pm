  Music is my first true love◊sidenote["zero-love"]{Computer games are my zeroeth true love.}.
  The first time I got my hands on an old untuned guitar, I didn't want to put it down.
  I found a summer job to buy my first instrument and pay for a teacher, and since then, music has been a constant source of joy in my life.
  Picking a CS degree at a university over a musical college education was a hard choice for me.
}

  I can't help but look at the world through my musical obsession.
  There are many deep similarities between music and computing but we won't explore them in this article.
  Instead, I will focus on a silly and subjective question: ◊quoted{If my favorite composers decided to write some code, which language would they pick?}.

◊p{
  ◊a[#:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach"]{Johan Sebastian Bach} is the most talented and prolific musician in history.

◊p{
  Bach would love the ◊a[#:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)"]{APL} programming language:
}
◊ul[#:class "arrows"]{
  ◊li{
    Like a well-written APL program, Bach's music is ◊em{dense}.
    He achieves immense expressive power with a few well-chosen constructs.
  }
  ◊li{
    In his lifetime, Bach was famous not for his compositions, but for his improvisation skills.
    APL is an excellent fit for live coding because of its interactivity and terseness.
  }
  ◊li{
    Motifs and keys bear deep symbolic and emotional meaning in Bach's music.
    A twisted motif might mean a crucifixion and a sequence of twelve beats might depict a clock striking midnight.
    APL assigns ingeniously-chosen symbols to all its primitives.
  }
  ◊li{
    Bach's productivity was phenomenal.
    For example, he was cranking at least one cantata (about 20 minutes of music) per week for church services on Sundays for over three years, writing over three hundred cantatas.
    And it wasn't even his primary duty.
    Tell me about your tight deadlines.
    The only programmer who can come close to this level of productivity must be an over-caffeinated APL wizard.
  }
  ◊li{
    The ◊a[#:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contents_of_the_Voyager_Golden_Record"]{Voyager Golden Record} contains three compositions by Bach.
    If we wanted to prove to aliens that we know how to compute, APL would be the best choice for writing programs on golden surfaces.

◊section-title["beethoven"]{Ludwig van Beethoven}
◊p{
  ◊a[#:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven"]{Beethoven} is the most influential composer in history.
  He single-handedly changed the direction of western music and the role of an artist in society.
}
◊p{
  One of the few languages worthy of Beethoven would be ◊a[#:href "https://www.haskell.org/"]{Haskell}:
}
◊ul[#:class "arrows"]{
  ◊li{
    Beethoven often constructed his music from the interaction and development of small motifs and rhythms, many of which initially seem trivial.
    The art of writing good Haskell code is composing programs from small functions, many of which do not do much when considered in isolation (◊code-ref["https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:id"]{id} and ◊code-ref["https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Function.html#v:fix"]{fix}, for example).
  }
  ◊li{
    Beethoven was constantly evolving his style, pushing the boundary of musical art.
    He reinvented himself three times during his career, turning his suffering into fuel for a breakthrough.
    Similarly, the Haskell ecosystem constantly evolves, turning pain points into new beautiful ways to write and think about software.
    For example, issues with lazy input/output led to the invention of ◊a[#:href "https://wiki.haskell.org/Iteratee_I/O"]{iteratees}, and problems with nested record updates led to optics (such as ◊a[#:href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-QwBL9Dia0"]{lenses}) and ◊a[#:href "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/icmt-2009-slides.pdf"]{bidirectional programming}.
  }
  ◊li{
    Beethoven turned my musical world upside down: I caught a piano bug after hearing one of his sonatas.
    Haskell enormously influenced my professional life, forever changing my thoughts about computing.
