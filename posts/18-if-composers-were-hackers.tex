\section{introduction}{Introduction}

Music is my first true love\sidenote{zero-love}{Computer games are my zeroeth true love.}.
The first time I got my hands on an old untuned guitar, I didn't want to put it down.
I found a summer job to buy my first instrument and pay for a teacher, and since then, music has been a constant source of joy in my life.
Picking a degree in computer science at a university over a musical college education was a hard choice for me.

I can't help but look at the world through my musical obsession.
There are many deep similarities between music and computing but we won't explore them in this article.
Instead, I will focus on a silly and subjective question: ``If my favorite composers decided to write some code, which language would they pick?''

\section{bach}{Johan Sebastian Bach}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach}{Johan Sebastian Bach} is the most talented and prolific musician in history.

Bach would love the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)}{APL} programming language:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Like a well-written APL program, Bach's music is \em{dense}.
    He achieves immense expressive power with a few well-chosen constructs.
  \item
    In his lifetime, Bach was famous not for his compositions, but for his improvisation skills.
    APL is an excellent fit for live coding because of its interactivity and terseness.
  \item
    Motifs and keys bear deep symbolic and emotional meaning in Bach's music.
    A twisted motif might mean a crucifixion and a sequence of twelve beats might depict a clock striking midnight.
    APL assigns ingeniously-chosen symbols to all its primitives.
  \item
    Bach's productivity was phenomenal.
    For example, he was cranking at least one cantata (about 20 minutes of music) per week for church services on Sundays for over three years, writing over three hundred cantatas.
    And it wasn't even his primary duty.
    Tell me about your tight deadlines.
    The only programmer who can come close to this level of productivity must be an over-caffeinated APL wizard.
  \item
    The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contents_of_the_Voyager_Golden_Record}{Voyager Golden Record} contains three compositions by Bach.
    If we wanted to prove to aliens that we know how to compute, APL would be the best choice for writing programs on golden surfaces.
\end{itemize}

\section{mozart}{Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart}{Mozart}'s musical genius was so bright and incomprehensible that mysteries and myths still surround his life.

Mozart would prefer the \href{https://www.scheme.org/}{Scheme} programming language.
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Mozart's music reflects the values of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment}{the age of enlightenment} and appeals to everyone.
    It's clean and beautifully constructed.
    Scheme is so simple that a few pages can introduce most of the language.
    Before the recent switch to Python, MIT professors used Scheme for \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&list=PLE18841CABEA24090}{introductory Computer Science classes}.
  \item
    Mozart wrote music in all genres of his time (though he loved theater and opera the most).
    Scheme is a programmable programming language; it is flexible enough to be helpful in any domain.
    See \href{https://racket-lang.org/}{Racket} and "The Little X" books in the \href{#mozart-scheme-resources}{Resources} section.

\section{beethoven}{Ludwig van Beethoven}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven}{Beethoven} is the most influential composer in history.
He single-handedly changed the direction of western music and the role of an artist in society.

One of the few languages worthy of Beethoven would be \href{https://www.haskell.org/}{Haskell}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Beethoven often constructed his music from the interaction and development of small motifs and rhythms, many of which initially seem trivial.
  The art of writing good Haskell code is composing programs from small functions, many of which do not do much when considered in isolation (\href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:id}{\code{id}} and \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Function.html#v:fix}{\code{fix}}, for example).
  \item
  Beethoven was constantly evolving his style, pushing the boundary of musical art.
  He reinvented himself three times during his career, turning his suffering into fuel for a breakthrough.
  Similarly, the Haskell ecosystem constantly evolves, turning pain points into new beautiful ways to write and think about software.
  For example, issues with lazy input/output led to the invention of \href{https://wiki.haskell.org/Iteratee_I/O}{iteratees}, and problems with nested record updates led to optics (such as \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-QwBL9Dia0}{lenses}) and \href{https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/icmt-2009-slides.pdf}{bidirectional programming}.
  \item
  Beethoven turned my musical world upside down: I caught a piano bug after hearing one of his sonatas.
  Haskell enormously influenced my professional life, forever changing my thoughts about computing.

\section{scriabin}{Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin}{Scriabin} is a relatively obscure (at least outside of Russia) Russian composer.
I find his music deeply expressive, emotional, and metaphysical.
Also, he had the most stylish mustache ever.

Scriabin would love \href{https://scala-lang.org/}{Scala}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Scriabin dreamed of fusing arts into a synthetic art form he called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_(Scriabin)}{Mysterium}.
  Similarly, Scala aims to be extensible enough to embrace all programming styles and paradigms (functional, object-oriented, actor-based, etc.).
  \item
  Scriabin's music feels profound and unfathomable, like the night sky.
  Looking at Scala code makes me feel the same awe: I admire its structure and elegance, but its inherent complexity makes my head spin.
\end{itemize}

\section{closing}{Closing words}

There are many more great composers and excellent programming languages.
Matching these is an exercise for the reader.

I encourage you to think more often about things and people you like and match them with others.
For example, \href{https://kpknudson.com/my-favorite-theorem/}{My Favorite Theorem} podcast hosts ask their guests to match their favorite theorems with items and activities in their lives, such as pizza and rock climbing.

Enjoy your \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G6dd7ikrXs}{favorite things}!
