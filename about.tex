Hi there!

My name is Roman Kashitsyn.

Before ChainLink Labs, I did hard-core software engineering at \href{https://dfinity.org}{\textsc{dfinity}} and worked on large-scale distributed systems at \href{https://shopping.google.com/}{Google.Shopping} and \href{https://yandex.ru/maps}{Yandex.Maps}.

\section{mmap}{What does ``mmap'' mean?}

``Mmap'' stands for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap}{memory-mapped file I/O}.
This ancient technology is a beam of light in the murk of the modern technological world darkened by unnecessary complexity and layers of abstractions.
I like \href{https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html}{\code{mmap}} so much that I called my blog after it.
