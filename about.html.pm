  I have also co-authored a few relatively popular ◊a[#:href "https://medium.com/dfinity/software-canisters-an-evolution-of-smart-contracts-internet-computer-f1f92f1bfffb"]{canisters}: registry, ledger, internet identity backend, and certified assets canister.

◊section-title["mmap"]{What does "mmap" mean?}
◊p{
  "Mmap" stands for ◊a[#:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap"]{memory-mapped file I/O}.
  This ancient technology is a beam of light in the murk of the modern technological world darkened by unnecessary complexity and layers of abstractions.
  I like ◊a[#:href "https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"]{mmap} so much that I called my blog after it.
